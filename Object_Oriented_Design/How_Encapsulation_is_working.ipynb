        "Encapsulation, a fundamental object-oriented design principle, contributes significantly to the effectiveness and robustness of the online messaging system. By hiding the internal details of the User, Message, and ChatRoom classes from external access, encapsulation ensures that users interact with the system through well-defined interfaces rather than manipulating internal attributes directly. This enhances information hiding and maintains a clear separation between the implementation and external interactions. The resulting code organization is modular, leading to a readable, maintainable, and scalable codebase. The complexity of the system is reduced as users engage with high-level methods and attributes, abstracting away the intricacies of the underlying implementation and simplifying system usage. Encapsulation further promotes ease of maintenance by reducing the risk of unintended interactions between different components, facilitating modifications or extensions to specific classes without affecting other parts of the system. This design choice enhances flexibility, allowing internal implementations to evolve without impacting the external code that relies on the encapsulated classes. Overall, encapsulation is pivotal in achieving a well-organized, maintainable, and flexible messaging system."
